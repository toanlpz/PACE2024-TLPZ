# PACE2024-TLPZ
 

This is a student submission to the heuristic track of the PACE 2024.
It approximates a solution to the One-Sided Crossings Minimisation Problem, using two problem-specific heuristics,
the median heuristic and the mean heuristic, as well as the simulated annealing technique.

To build this project, use CMake or compile it with any C compiler (eg GCC). This project does not rely on any external library
